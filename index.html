            <p>The Eraserheads are one of the most important artists in the history of Pinoy
                rock music. Often described
                as the Philippines' own Beatles, the Eraserheads brought their melodic guitar rock and keen wit from
                Manila's underground scene and into the mainstream. The group can be compared to Nirvana in how they
                knocked superficial pop from the airwaves and the charts, triggering a wave of commercial acceptance for
                alternative music. The Eraserheads formed at University of the Philippines in 1989. Schoolmates Ely
                Buendia (lead vocals, guitar), Marcus Adoro (lead guitars), Buddy Zabala (bass), and Raymund Marasigan
                (drums) played covers at several universities. The band became disillusioned at how poorly they remade
                other artists' songs so they began writing their own. In 1990, the Eraserheads started performing at the
                alternative hotbed Club Dredd, quickly establishing an impressive fan base. However, record labels were
                not interested in the group, and their demo album, Pop-U, faced continual rejection until the band
                produced a new version of one of its tracks, capturing the attention of BMG Records (Pilipinas). In
                1993, the Eraserheads released their first album, Ultraelectromagneticpop, for the label. The record was
                a bona fide smash. Just as Nirvana achieved stardom in America with stripped-down rock and an unassuming
                image, the Eraserheads topped the charts in Manila with their independent spirit and distinctive sound.
                In 1996, the Eraserheads' album Cutterpillow went gold via pre-release sales before record stores even
                had copies; the album was eventually certified platinum eight times, the highest-selling album ever in
                the Philippines. In 1998, the band extended its visibility beyond the Philippines by releasing a
                compilation of remastered greatest hits, Aloha Milkyway, to the Asian market. In 1999, the Eraserheads
                even received limited airplay on the influential Los Angeles alternative rock station KROQ. In 2001, the
                Eraserheads released Carbon Stereoxide.
